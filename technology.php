                    <p>Ecological Technologies Limited Products has technology to manufacture buildings using recycled
                        plastic waste. The target market is the developing world where the need for affordable houses,
                        refugee shelters, temperature controlled units for storage of food and medicines, and camps
                        (hospitals, schools, temporary living) for disasters and emergency situations is massive.</p>
                    <p>
                        Plastic timber materials, when used in place of treated lumber, are resistant to flies, rot,
                        corrosion, and a variety of chemicals.

                    <h2><span>Manufacturing Of</span> Plastic Pallets</h2>
                    <p>Pallets can be made from a number of materials other than wood, such as plastic or metal. A
                        plastic pallet is cheaper than a metal one and less prone to mildew and infestation than a
                        wooden one, and it doesn’t absorb moisture. As a result, many businesses have been converting
                        from wood to plastic for material-handling equipment.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are six main processes for manufacturing a plastic pallet: High-Pressure Injection
                        Moulding, Structural Foam Moulding, Thermoforming, Compression Moulding, Rotational Moulding,
                        and Profile Extrusion.

                <h2>Types Of Material Used</h2>
                <p>There are two types of plastic-lumber products: “composites” (wood products made from a combination
                    of plastics and natural fibers) and “wood-like” products made entirely of plastics. Many of these
                    items use recycled plastics, which diverts waste from landfills and can benefit the atmosphere. The
                    plastic lumber industry owes its existence primarily to the discovery of a use for plastic scrap and
                    post-consumer plastic waste. These modern products are now displacing conventional construction
                    materials in some applications. Global demand for these plastic lumber products is increasing, owing
                    to a growth in their potential building applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wood–plastic composites (WPCs) are made up of fibers mixed with a polymer. Natural fiber composites,
                    for example, blend nylon with flax or hemp. This content first gained popularity in Western Europe
                    with German automakers. Natural composites currently average between 7 and 10 kg (15 and 22 lb.) per
                    vehicle in nonstructural applications such as interior panels, headliners, seat panels, parcel
                    racks, and acoustic panels for companies such as BMW and DaimlerChrysler.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wood composites, on the other hand, are materials made from a mix of wood fibers and plastics. Their
                    different properties (including longevity and weather resistance) make them ideal for outdoor
                    construction applications such as decking/railing systems, window/door profiles, shingles, highway
                    sound walls, and infrastructure items such as boardwalks, picnic tables, and park benches. Natural
                    fiber and wood composite materials will also be manufactured from virgin plastic or
                    post-consumer/industrial reclaimed material. Virgin polymers have more cosmetic alternatives, such
                    as pigmentation options and reproducible patterns, but they can also be more expensive. Specialty
                    additives/pigments, such as color preservation and ultraviolet (UV) ray protection, can be used in
                    potentially less costly composites using recycled plastic to increase aesthetics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Polyethylene (PE) is the most commonly used polymer in composite applications in North America.
                    However, due to increased use of the commodity and increasing exports abroad, post-consumer supply
                    is tightening. This, along with ongoing research into new polymer compositions and processing
                    methods (for example, injection molding), which increase demand for other plastic materials such as
                    polypropylene (PP). As this occurs, these new materials can deliver their own distinct properties
                    and characteristics, further altering how specifiers and other design professionals perceive WPCs.
                    (Polypropylene, for example, may be oriented to have greater stiffness.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Green construction promotes longevity and resiliency, as well as low maintenance and a long-life
                    span. Plastic timber has many benefits over its more conventional predecessors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to a US Army Corps of Engineers report, composite materials are long-lasting, stable,
                    flexible, and resistant to weather, rust, mildew, and termites (without chemical
                    pressure-treatment). Furthermore, plastic lumber materials do not need to be repainted or restrained
                    on a daily basis. These materials are also workable with standard carpentry equipment and, for the
                    most part, require little maintenance.
